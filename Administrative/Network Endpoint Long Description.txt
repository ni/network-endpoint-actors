==================================
Network Endpoints allow you to link actor trees running in separate application instances.  Use them to build systems distributed across mulitple computing platforms.

Network endpoints can support a range of network protocols.  Two are provided with this package:  TCP/IP and Network Streams.  Users can also extend the package to change how messages are serialized and/or encrypt the serialized message.

Two types are included:  Nested Endpoints and Caller Endpoints.

A Nested Endpoint is launched by a calling actor.  Any message it receives from across the network will be passed up to its caller.

A Caller Endpoint sits at the top of an actor tree, and launches a single nested actor that you specify.  Any message it receives from across the network will be passed down to the nested actor.
